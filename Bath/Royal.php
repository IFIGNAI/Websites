            Royal Crescent is a striking row of 30 terraced houses known for their
            iconic curved design and Georgian architecture. Built between 1767 and 1775,
            it was designed by renowned architect John Wood the Younger.
            The Crescent is considered one of the finest examples of Georgian town planning,
            with its grand Palladian fa√ßade overlooking a lush green lawn. Today,
            Royal Crescent is a symbol of elegance and history,
            housing private residences, a luxury hotel and the
            No. 1 Royal Crescent Museum, which showcases life in the 18th century.
