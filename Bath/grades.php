        <p><h3>Good Design Techniques - CRAP.</h3> For this site I used useful functions of
            the CRAP design principle. I made any text and title easy to read and
            the images did not interfere with reading.</p>
        <br>
        <p><h3>Organization of information.</h3> All information about the city was divided
            into several components and those in turn into subcomponents.
            The volume of text is not large everywhere so as not to overload
            the reader with a huge amount of information.</p>
        <br>
        <p><h3>Content.</h3> I tried to find and use only interesting and generalized information.
            I did it so that when reading, an ordinary user would become interested
            in the city and decide to go there.</p>
        <br>
        <p><h3>10 Content Pages.</h3> The project has only 12 pages
            (not including the link to the about me), 2 of which
            are grades page and source.</p>
        <br>
        <p><h3>Code Design Requirements.</h3> I tried to implement the website code
            carefully without serious problems. Unfortunately, I did not add comments
            (I just donâ€™t know what to say in them).</p>
        <br>
        <p><h3>Interaction Design & Navigation.</h3> The site has both global and internal
            navigation for easy use.</p>
        <br>
        <p><h3>HTML & CSS Validates.</h3> I did everything according to the rules of correct
            formatting.</p>
        <br>
        <p><h3>Reference Page.</h3> Consists of Wikipedia and sites from which I took photos</p>
        <br>
        <p><h3>Grading Page Document.</h3> You are reading it now.</p>
        <br>
        <p><h3>Responsive Web Design</h3> Media queries were added</p>
        <p><h3>Php structure</h3> Fully rewrited website to php</p>
        <p><h3>Java script</h3> Script to Show/hide comments in comments.php</p>
        <p><h3>My sql db</h3> Database with comments was added in comments.php</p>
