            The Holburne Museum is a renowned art museum that houses an impressive collection
            of fine and decorative arts. Housed in a stately Grade I listed building at the end of
            Great Pulteney Street, the museum was originally founded in 1882 to display the personal
            collection of Sir William Holburne. Its exhibits span the centuries, including works
            by artists such as Gainsborough, Stubbs and Turner, as well as ceramics,
            silver and sculpture. The museum also hosts contemporary art exhibitions and
            educational programmes, making it a vibrant cultural destination in the heart of Bath.
