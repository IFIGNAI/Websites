                    Mixed reality is a combination of virtual (completely replacing the view of the surrounding world with a digital one using virtual reality glasses)
                    and augmented (adding digital objects to the physical world through virtual reality glasses) realities. 
                    In this product from Apple, they figured out how to use ordinary gestures to change these realities among themselves and work in them.
