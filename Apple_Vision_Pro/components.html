                    Apple Vision Pro has a modern design that combines glass and aluminum. 
                    The main body material is aluminum, and the front part is made of durable glass.
                    On the front panel there is an OLED display that displays information for the user.
                    These solutions allow this headset to be very resistant to damage and at the same time very stylish.
                </p>

                    The headset is equipped with two microLED displays with a total resolution of 23 million pixels.
                    The lenses, developed jointly with Zeiss, can be used for vision correction and are attached using magnets.
                    This allows the glasses to transmit images in high quality and not strain the user’s vision.

                    The device has 12 cameras, including four cameras for tracking the user's gaze and Optic ID functions,
                    as well as five sensors (TrueDepth and LiDAR). Six microphones are provided for communication with the user. 
                    These cameras allow you to track the direction of the eyes to highlight objects on the screen 
                    (the same as using a mouse on a monitor, where a click is either a finger gesture or a blink)
                     as well as track the behavior of the user’s hands to control the interface.
                </p>

                    The speakers are located in the headband of the device near the user's ears and 
                    support surround sound using Spatial Audio technology. This solution allows you to make 
                    the sound both isolated (no external stimuli will be heard) and combined (you will hear both the real world and the virtual one)
                </p>

                    Apple Vision Pro is equipped with an external battery that provides up to two hours of operation. 
                    It can also be connected to an electrical outlet to extend battery life.
                </p>

                    The headset supports connection to external Bluetooth devices and can transfer images from a Mac computer
                    to augmented reality. Author's comment - "I was in unreal shock from this function :0"
