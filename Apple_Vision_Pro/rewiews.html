                        Even though the headset came out only recently, many journalists have already reviewed the Apple Vision Pro, and this is what they say.

                        Road to VR - "It's not just Vision Pro itself, it's Apple. 
                        Everything about the device suggests the company does not consider the headset 
                        a tech demo. It's in this for the long haul, likely with a forward-looking roadmap of 
                        at least 10 years. And even then, it's not that Apple is magical and going to make the best 
                        stuff in the industry all the time; it's that the things it does well are going to set the bar for 
                        others to compete against, resulting in accelerated progress for everyone. That's something Meta has 
                        needed for a long time."

                        Upload to VR - "My first moment with Vision Pro seeing the physical room viewed through the headset's
                        display in passthrough, I looked down at my own hands and it felt as if I was looking at them directly. This was a powerful moment,
                        more powerful than any previous "first" I'd experienced in VR. I feel the need to reiterate. I was looking at my own hands 
                        reconstructed by a headset's sensors and it felt as if I was looking at them directly."

                        The Verge – “The Vision Pro is an astounding product. It’s the sort of first-generation device only Apple can really make, 
                        from the incredible display and passthrough engineering, to the use of the whole ecosystem to make it so seamlessly useful, 
                        to even getting everyone to pretty much ignore the whole external battery situation. There's a part of me that says the 
                        Vision Pro only exists because Apple is so incredibly capable, stocked with talent, and loaded with resources that the company 
                        simply went out and engineered the hell out of the hardest problems it could think of in order to find a challenge.”
