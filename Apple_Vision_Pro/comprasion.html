                    In addition to the Apple Vision Pro mixed reality glasses from Apple, at relatively the same time the company META (also known as Facebook) released its headset called META Quest. This headset is called an affordable analogue of Apple vision pro. Precisely because she was called that, let's compare them.

                    <h3>Processor</h3>
                <img src="images/compare.jpg" alt="processor">
                <p>
                    Apple Vision Pro: Equipped with the Apple Silicon M1 processor, which ensures high performance and efficient operation of the device.
                    META Quest: Powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon XR2 processor, which also offers good performance but may be slightly less powerful compared to the Apple Silicon M1.
                </p>
                    <h3>Cameras</h3>
                <p>
                    Apple Vision Pro: equipped with LiDAR and TrueDepth cameras for facial recognition and creating realistic effects in augmented reality.
                    META Quest: has built-in cameras to track the user's movements.
                </p>
                    <h3>Sound</h3>
                <p>
                    Apple Vision Pro: Provides surround sound for an enhanced audio experience.
                    META Quest: has built-in speakers and the ability to connect headphones for high-quality sound.
                </p>
                    <h3>OS</h3>
                <p>
                    Apple Vision Pro: Runs on the iOS operating system, providing a smooth and convenient experience with other Apple devices.
                    META Quest: Runs on the Android operating system, which provides access to a wide range of applications and content.
                </p>
                    <h3>Price</h3>
                <p>
                    Apple Vision Pro: Expected to cost around $3,000-$4,000, making it a more expensive option.
                    META Quest: The base model of META Quest 2 is available for $299, making it a more affordable option for users.
                </p>
                    <h3>Overall</h3>
                <p>
                    So, Apple Vision Pro offers higher specifications, advanced technologies and a quality user experience, but at a higher price. 
                    META Quest, on the other hand, is a more affordable solution with good picture and sound quality. 
                    Initially, it seems that Apple has greatly increased the price for its product, but the reason is the OS and the 10-core processor. 
                    It is these two arguments that allow the user to work in a very smooth and pleasing to the eye interface and, most importantly, 
                    to interact with other devices, which allows us to call this headset a truly breakthrough!
